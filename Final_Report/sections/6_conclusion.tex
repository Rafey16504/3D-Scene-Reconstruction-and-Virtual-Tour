\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we built a system for 3D scene reconstruction and interactive visualization. We captured photographs of an indoor scene, reconstructed a 3D point cloud using professional photogrammetry software, and created a web-based viewer for the result.

Our approach involved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementing a basic Structure from Motion pipeline to understand 3D reconstruction
    \item Recognizing the limitations of basic SfM and switching to professional tools (Agisoft MetaShape)
    \item Capturing additional images to improve reconstruction quality
    \item Building a Three.js application for interactive 3D visualization with mouse and keyboard controls
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professional photogrammetry tools produce much better results than basic computer vision implementations
    \item More images and diverse viewpoints improve reconstruction quality
    \item Web-based 3D visualization is practical and accessible
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application was developed and tested only on our desktop system
    \item No formal user testing or evaluation was performed
    \item The quality of reconstruction depends heavily on image capture and camera coverage
\end{itemize}
