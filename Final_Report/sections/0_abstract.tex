    This project demonstrates 3D scene reconstruction from photographs and interactive 3D visualization. We captured multiple images of an indoor scene and attempted Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstruction using SIFT feature detection and matching. Initial results were unsatisfactory, so we used Agisoft MetaShape for photogrammetry-based reconstruction. To improve the point cloud quality, we captured additional images and reprocessed them with MetaShape, resulting in a significantly better reconstruction. The final high-quality point cloud was used to develop an interactive web-based virtual tour application using Three.js. The application allows users to navigate the 3D scene with mouse and keyboard controls. This project demonstrates the practical workflow of 3D reconstruction from image capture to interactive visualization.
