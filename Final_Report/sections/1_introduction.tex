\section{Introduction}

3D scene reconstruction from photographs is useful for creating virtual tours and digital models of physical spaces. In this project, we worked on reconstructing an indoor scene from images and creating an interactive web-based viewer for the resulting 3D model.

Our project workflow involved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Capturing photographs of an indoor scene
    \item Attempting 3D reconstruction using Structure from Motion techniques
    \item Using professional photogrammetry software (Agisoft MetaShape) for better results
    \item Capturing additional images to improve reconstruction quality
    \item Building an interactive Three.js application for 3D visualization
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Project Overview}
The goal of this project was to go from raw photographs to an interactive 3D virtual tour application. We explored both traditional computer vision techniques and professional photogrammetry tools to achieve the best possible 3D reconstruction, then implemented a web-based viewer with intuitive controls for exploring the reconstructed environment.
